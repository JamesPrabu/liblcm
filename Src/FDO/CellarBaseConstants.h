// We temporarily have two build processes going.
// In the Nant build process, a file similar to this but without these initial comments is generated.
// In the MSBuild/XBuild process which is replacing it, we simply copy this file to the place where
// it is needed by the rest of the build process. Eventually we may improve the build to just use this.
// Once we are using only the new process, in the unlikely event of changes to this file, consistent
// changes should be made also to Common/CoreImpl/CellarPropertyTypes.cs. In the meantime, change CmTypes as well.
// Generated by target 'GenerateFilesFromModel-build' from CmTypes.txt
