// Warning! Do NOT use kcptUnicode for language data (either vernacular or analysis).
// It is NOT parallel to kcptMultiUnicode; that has a WS specified for each alternative,
// but kcptUnicode has NO WS information. Support for kcptUnicode being used as strings is
// spotty but should not be counted on. Use kcptString for short language strings and
// kcptBigString for long ones. There is NO good way to represent a monolingual string
// that is forced to have only one writing system along its length; if we need that, let's
// add it, but please don't abuse kcptUnicode. (JohnT)
